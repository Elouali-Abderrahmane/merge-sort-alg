# Merge Sort Algorithm in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, one of the most efficient sorting algorithms with a time complexity of **O(n log n)**.

### Features:
- Recursive approach to divide and conquer.
- Pythonic implementation with clear and concise code.
- Handles arrays of any size and sorts them efficiently.

### Why Learn Merge Sort?
Learning algorithms like Merge Sort is fundamental for every developer. Understanding the logic behind sorting and recursion helps in solving real-world problems and prepares you for coding interviews.
